    Speak a message aloud to notify the user.

    Use this tool ONLY when you need to get the user's attention after
    a long-running task has completed. Do not use for routine responses.

    Good examples:
    - "Your build has completed successfully"
    - "The test suite finished with 3 failures"
    - "Deployment is complete"
    - "I found the bug you were looking for"

    Args:
        message: The message to speak aloud. Keep it brief and informative.
        voice: Voice to use for speech (default: alba). Can be a built-in
               voice name or path to an audio file for voice cloning.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with success status and details.
